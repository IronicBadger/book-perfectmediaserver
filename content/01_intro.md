## About the series

This site has been created as an evergreen resource for the "Perfect Media Server", a series of blog posts that began life over at [blog.linuxserver.io](https://blog.linuxserver.io/tag/perfectmediaserver/). Since taking a step back from LSIO, those posts continue to be very popular. 

Given that I am no longer involved at LSIO, it seemed like a good idea to put all of this information in one place. And in an open-source format where the community will always have access to this information via Github even if I get hit by the proverbial bus.

The Perfect Media Server is written and maintained by [Alex Kretzschmar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-kretzschmar/) (aka [IronicBadger](https://twitter.com/ironicbadger)).

Alex is a Red Hatter by day and a giant nerd by night (wait, I think I'm a full-time nerd actually).

If you like this kind of thing, check out the [Self-Hosted](https://selfhosted.show) podcast over at Jupiter Broadcasting.

I also write technical posts over on my blog at [blog.ktz.me](https://blog.ktz.me) covering topics from Openshift to Terraform to electronics and Home Automation.
