Storing and serving files is all well and good but with a little effort, we can replace dozens of hosted services that don't respect your privacy. Here are some of my favourite self-hosted app picks.

## 1. Nextcloud

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) - The self-hosted productivity platform that keeps you in control.

Surely this pick needs no introduction. Think of Nextcloud somewhat like your own personal Dropbox replacement. Although, that is doing it a disservice because Nextcloud supports *many* more features than Dropbox. Nextcloud provide a [demo](https://nextcloud.com/try) if you'd like to try before you "buy" (Nextcloud is free).

The recently launched [Nextcloud Hub](https://nextcloud.com/hub) brings together several key areas of functionality:

* [Nextcloud Files](https://nextcloud.com/files) - offers universal file access on desktop, mobile and web. Find files with powerful search, share your thoughts in comments or lock files until you are done with them. 
* [Nextcloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk) - delivers on-premises, private audio/video conferencing and text chat through browser and mobile interfaces with integrated screen sharing and SIP integration.
* [Nextcloud Groupware](https://nextcloud.com/groupware) - integrates Calendar, Contacts, Mail and other productivity features to help teams get their work done faster, easier and on your terms.
