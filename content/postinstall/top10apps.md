# Top 10 Self-Hosted apps

One of the requirements for an always-on system in my house is that it must *do* something. Storing and serving files is all well and good but with a little effort, we can replace dozens of hosted services that don't respect your privacy. We can also save a little money too by bringing this stuff in house.

## 1. Nextcloud

<a href="https://nextcloud.com/" title="Nextcloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nextcloud</a> - The self-hosted productivity platform that keeps you in control.

Surely this pick needs no introduction. Think of Nextcloud somewhat like your own personal Dropbox replacement. Although, that is doing it a disservice because Nextcloud supports *many* more features than Dropbox. Nextcloud provide a <a href="https://try.nextcloud.com/" title="Try Nextcloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">demo</a> if you'd like to try before you "buy".

The recently launched <a href="https://nextcloud.com/hub/" title="Nextcloud Hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nextcloud Hub</a> bring together several key areas of functionality:

* <a href="https://nextcloud.com/files" title="Nextcloud Hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nextcloud Files</a> - offers universal file access on desktop, mobile and web. Find files with powerful search, share your thoughts in comments or lock files until you are done with them. 
* <a href="https://nextcloud.com/talk" title="Nextcloud Talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nextcloud Talk</a> - delivers on-premises, private audio/video conferencing and text chat through browser and mobile interfaces with integrated screen sharing and SIP integration.
* <a href="https://nextcloud.com/groupware" title="Nextcloud Groupware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nextcloud Groupware</a> - integrates Calendar, Contacts, Mail and other productivity features to help teams get their work done faster, easier and on your terms.
