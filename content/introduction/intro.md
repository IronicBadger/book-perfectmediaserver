# Welcome

If you're looking to build a media server, then you've come to the right place. This site documents the many aspects of building a media server using Free and Open Source Software wherever possible.

The primary technologies we recommend are [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), Containers (via [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and managed using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)), [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/), [MergerFS](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/), [SnapRAID](http://www.snapraid.it/) and [ZFS on Linux](https://zfsonlinux.org/).

## The aims of this site

This site covers the software side of building a server, there are plenty of other great resources for hardware such as [serverbuilds.net](https://serverbuilds.net). There is a short hardware section but this more aimed at sharing lessons learned than it is recommending specific builds.

The potential scope of this project could be vast. There are many flavours of Linux, many hypervisors and so on. Therefore, in order that this documentation remains manageable, we only cover a small subset of the options available. However, using the knowledge and thought patterns behind our decisions here you will leave armed with the ability to build your own DIY NAS or as we like to call it, the Perfect Media Server.

## About the series

Perfect Media Server began life as a series of blog posts over at [blog.linuxserver.io](https://blog.linuxserver.io/tag/perfectmediaserver/). Those posts continue to be very popular, but with so much information to be communicated something with search and a table of contents was needed.

I am no longer involved with LSIO, so it seemed like a good idea to put all of this information in one place and provid it in an open-source format. This site is created using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and PRs will be gladly considered via Github (using the icon in the top right) if you'd like to correct something here or share your own pearls of wisdom.
